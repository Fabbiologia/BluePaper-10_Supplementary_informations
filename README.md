#### Folder and dataset description

This data refers to a fully reproducible analysis associated with the Blue Paper 10: **"A Global Habitat Strategy Framework"** section. 

This folder contains all the datasets extracted from various sources and ordered in the final dataset called: `data/BP-10-Dataset.xlsx`

In the data folder are also stored various ordered datasets used to merge a final data, stored in the folder `data/sources`, along with a `data/raw` folder where raw datasets, as they were downloaded from internet, are saved. 

The `BP-10-dataset.xlsx` is an excel file with three sheets: `eez_hab`, `ecosocial` and `protected_area`


## eez_hab

In this sheet all Countries' Economical Exclusive Zones (EEZs), Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and extension of various habitat areas are reported. 



All areas are `km^2`, beware that some habitats were available only as point coordinates and are adimensional, these are: 
- Saltmarshes; 
- Kelp; 
- Hydrothermal_vents; 
- Cold_Coral;


## ecosocial

in this sheet social and economical variables are reported from various sources (World Bank/Ocean Health Index etc.)


## protected_area

This feature how much of each habitat is under some kind of PA. 

Please note that this *does not necesarily mean that this habitat is under direct protection*, since the MPA could have a management that do not include that kind of habitat. This data has been created by a spatial intersection of the habitat extention and the designated MPA a country has.
